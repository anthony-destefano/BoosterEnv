\section{Reproducing DSNE 200 km Tables using CREME96}

The 200 km LET (Linear Energy Transfer) and particle flux environments SLS-SPEC-159 Cross-Program Design Specification for Natural Environments (DSNE) were obtained using the Cosmic Ray Effects on Microelectrons 96 (CREME96\footnote{\url{https://creme.isde.vanderbilt.edu/}}). In this section, DSNE Tables 3.2.13-1 -- 3 are reproduced using the technical notes provided in the DSNE.

For the LET and flux, the \textsf{GTRN} routine is ran using the following options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 200 km circular orbit
	\item 51.6 degrees orbit inclination
	\item Effective L-shell range: $2.4 \le L \le 2.55$
	\item Stormy magnetic weather conditions
\end{itemize}
